* **CSS3:** For all styling, including the color palette, layout (Flexbox & Grid), animations, and responsive design.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the dynamic functionality, including:
    * Fetching and rendering project data from `database.json`.
    * Implementing the scroll-reveal animations.

## How It Works

The portfolio's project section is powered by the `database.json` file. The `app.js` script fetches this file, reads the list of projects, and dynamically creates a project card for each entry.

To add a new project, you can either manually edit the `database.json` file or use the included `add-project.html` page, which provides a user-friendly form and generates the correctly formatted JSON for you.
